# SpeakerRecognition

<i>class project for Algorithm Design and Analysis</i>

Use MFCC, KMeans and HMM to recognize a speaker(referenced to some public codes)

<b>Need</b> .wav input samples.

<b>Offer</b> a raw noise reduction by cutting off lower than 10% (or 5%) volume voice.<br \>
And it is only fit for WAV files that are not edited (confused about the headers of various WAVs).
